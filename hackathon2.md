REQUIREMENTS
WHAT TO BUILD

Build a new working application that tackles one of the challenges provided by one of the following partners.

Your submission must integrate both Google Cloud products (Vertex AI, Gemini, etc.) and the specific partner’s technologies to deliver a compelling and innovative solution.

Elastic Challenge: Build the Future of AI-Powered Search using Elastic’s hybrid search capabilities and seamless integration with Google Cloud’s generative AI tools to build a conversational and/or agent-based solution that transforms how people interact with data. 

Deliver an intelligent, interactive, and context-aware solution that showcases how Elastic + Google Cloud can reimagine daily life activities or business processes through AI.


Fivetran Challenge: Build your own custom data connector with the Fivetran Connector SDK, load that data into Google Cloud (BigQuery, Cloud Storage, or Cloud SQL) using Fivetran’s automated pipelines, and leverage Google Cloud AI services like Vertex AI or AgentSpace to develop an industry-focused AI application powered by your new dataset. 

Showcase your technical creativity by connecting new data sources and transforming them into usable applications that drive better decisions, improve customer experiences, or boost operational efficiency.

Solutions should be relevant to modern AI/data, including LLMs, agentic apps or workflows, RAG, automation, or augmented analytics.

WHAT TO SUBMIT

Include a URL to the hosted Project for judging and testing.

Include a URL to your Open Source code repository to show how your project was built. 

The repository must contain all necessary source code, assets, and instructions required for the project to be functional.

ABOUT THE PARTNERS

Elastic

Elastic, a two-time recipient of the Partner of the Year Award in AI from Google Cloud, helps you turn endless data possibilities into real results with the power of Search AI. Take advantage of all your data. Secure your private information. Optimize your infrastructure. Build smarter apps.

The developer-centric, open source Search AI Platform is built for scale and speed. It runs on a distributed search and vector database with a fast analytics engine. Whether you're indexing billions of logs, hunting threats across years of data, or retrieving massive vector embeddings, you get everything you need: instantly searchable results, AI-driven relevance, and real-time analysis.

Fivetran

Fivetran is the global leader in automated data movement, delivering ready-to-use data connectors that make access to data as simple and reliable as electricity. With Fivetran, organizations can eliminate the complexity of building and maintaining pipelines, ensuring data teams always have fresh, accurate data available where they need it. By automating schema management, monitoring, and maintenance, Fivetran allows developers and engineers to focus on innovation rather than infrastructure.

The Fivetran Connector SDK allows you to build production-ready custom data connectors in Python—without managing infrastructure. You write the logic to extract data from any unique or proprietary source, while Fivetran handles orchestration, scaling, compute resources, retries, and idempotency. This means you can focus on unlocking new data and delivering business outcomes faster for any Google Cloud workload.
